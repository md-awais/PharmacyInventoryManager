# üßæ Pharmacy Inventory Manager - WinForms Project

## üìå Project Overview

A lightweight, pharmacy-focused inventory management system built using **C# WinForms**, simulating a real-world pharmacy environment. Allowing users to **Add**, **Update**, **Delete**, and **View** medicines, along with persistent **CSV file storage** to retain data between sessions.

---

## üéØ Purpose of the Project

* To simulate pharmacy workflows and showcase understanding of **user experience**, **scalability**, and **maintenance**.
* To reflect experience in **C#**, **WinForms**, and **Microsoft SQL principles**, with modular, clean code.

## üèóÔ∏è Features Implemented

| Feature            | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Add Medicine`     | Add a new medicine with name, category, quantity, supplier, and price.           |
| `View Medicines`   | View all records in a `DataGridView` with column autofit and full row selection. |
| `Update Medicine`  | Auto-fills form on row click. Updates record after modifying any field.          |
| `Delete Medicine`  | Deletes a selected row using ID.                                                 |
| `Data Persistence` | Uses CSV file (`medicine_inventory.csv`) for save/load.                          |
| `Form Auto-fill`   | On selecting a row, all textboxes fill with that record‚Äôs data.                  |

## üîó Architecture & Integration

### ‚úÖ Files Created:

* `Medicine.cs` ‚Äî Model class (POCO) for medicine entity.
* `MedicineService.cs` ‚Äî Business logic layer with add, update, delete, save, and load.
* `Form1.cs` ‚Äî UI logic: button click handlers and UI-data connection.
* `Form1.Designer.cs` ‚Äî Auto-generated UI layout.
* `medicine_inventory.csv` ‚Äî Persistent storage of medicine data.

### ‚úÖ Code Flow:

1. `Form1.cs` handles UI interactions.
2. Calls to `MedicineService.cs` execute logic.
3. Data is stored in a list and synced to CSV file.
4. App reads from CSV on launch to preload all data.

### ‚úÖ Event Linkages:

| Control        | Linked Method                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `btnAdd`       | `btnAdd_Click()`                                 |
| `btnView`      | `btnView_Click()`                                |
| `btnUpdate`    | `btnUpdate_Click()`                              |
| `btnDelete`    | `btnDelete_Click()`                              |
| `dgvMedicines` | `dgvMedicines_CellClick()` (auto-fill textboxes) |

## üß† Logic Breakdown

### MedicineService.cs

* List-based storage (`List<Medicine> _medicines`)
* File IO: `SaveToFile()` and `LoadFromFile()` using `System.IO`
* Incremental ID management

### Form1.cs

* CRUD operations bound to buttons
* `DataGridView` updates on demand
* Uses `ClearFields()` to reset form state
